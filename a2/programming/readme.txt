CSC418 Assignment 2
-----------------------

The compiled skeleton code will display a solid shaded
cube located at the origin. You can move the cube using
the UI (Root->translate x/y/z). A sample keyframe file
has been provided and can be loaded to demonstrate the
animation and render to file capabilites.

The following are NOT functional and need to be implemented
by you:
-------------------------------------
1) Update keyframe button
2) Render style selection buttons (wireframe / solid / solid w/ wireframe)
3) A penguin model

Start by reading through the code to become familiar with it.
I suggest implementing things in the order mentioned above;
it should make testing and debugging easier. 

Once you are done with the above, add material properties,
enable lighting, and add the necessary user interface controls
to control the light source position.

If you have questions, post to the forum.
Good luck!
