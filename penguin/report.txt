CSC418 Assignment 1 Report

Part 1 Introduction

The assignment 1 is not the first time that I program with a graphic library. In
the ECE297 course, I've a map project with EasyGL written by one of the ECE pro
fessor and I expected the whole experience should be similar. However, the state
properties of OpenGL actually complex my development process, but after getting
use to it, I started to understand the process. The whole program was written
within 10 hours of working time.

Part 2 Design Phase

The design phase is actually the hardest part in this assignment. We were only
given a rough drawing of the penguin, no other specific information was given.
Therefore I need to use my imagination to draw the penguin as closely as possible
to the drawing.

The method that I use is some kind linear mapping, where I selected the approximate
center of the body and the build up a Euclidean coordinate system for there. I
roughly measured all the relative vertices and rotation point that were shown in
the system.Record and categorize them in to different group according to the body
part they belong to.

After the mapping, I started to design some of the basic interfaces that I need
for the drawing. I found that the body, the head ,and the mouth of the penguin are
irregular polygon, so I define drawPolygon as the basic drawing API for the body
and the mouth. For the circles, I modified the drawPolygon algorithm and approximate
circle with multi-polygons, called drawCircle and drawCircleFilled corresponding to
filling or not filling the circle. I have accommodate the original drawSquare
method from the started code just so that I do not need to re-design any API that
related to rectangle.In order to pass coordinates into the method, I design a vector
structure that could be pass into the method as an array.

The body of the penguin is a six-side irregular polygon, which could be drawn
using drawPolygon method. Similarly, the head of the penguin is a five-side polygon
which can also be drawn using drawPolygon method. Any irregular 4-side polygon such
as the wings and the mouth are drawn using the drawPolygon method too.
